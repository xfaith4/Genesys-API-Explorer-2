5. **Code Quality**: Follow existing code patterns and PowerShell best practices
6. **Documentation**: Update README.md as features are added

### Testing Strategy
- Syntax validation after each change
- Manual testing of new features
- Verify existing features still work
- Test with various API endpoints
- Test error conditions

### Success Criteria
Each phase is complete when:
- All features in the phase are implemented and tested
