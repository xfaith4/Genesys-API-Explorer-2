# Insight Briefings

This folder is the default landing place for exported insight pack briefings.
The Ops Console populates it at runtime; do not delete generated `.html`, `.xlsx`, or `.json` files unless you no longer need them.

> Legacy note: older builds used `InsightBriefings/` at the repo root.
