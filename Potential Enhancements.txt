To set your PowerShell-based Genesys Cloud API Explorer apart from the official https://developer.genesys.cloud/devapps/api-explorer, consider adding advanced and unique features that enhance usability, automation, and integration capabilities beyond what a browser-based explorer offers.

Here are some compelling ideas:

Integrated Scripting and Automation

Allow users to save API requests as reusable PowerShell script snippets or modules.
Provide a script generation feature that generates ready-to-run PowerShell scripts for requests with chosen parameters.
Schedule automated API calls with logging and alerts directly from the tool.
Advanced Authentication Support

Include OAuth2 full flow with token refresh mechanism.
Support multiple auth profiles to switch between different customer environments or roles.
Secure token storage encrypted on disk.
Rich Parameter Editors

JSON schema-aware editors with validation, autocomplete, and syntax highlighting for body parameters.
Dropdowns for enum values.
Conditional parameter display based on other parameter selections.
Request & Response History and Logging

Keep a timestamped history of past requests and responses with ability to filter and search.
Export/import request history for sharing or auditing.
Ability to replay requests or modify and resend.
Response Visualization

Render JSON responses in a collapsible tree UI.
Graph and chart rendering for analytics data returned by APIs.
Auto-detect and render binary or media content inline.
Multi-Request Workflows

Design workflows that chain multiple API requests together with variables to pass data between steps.
Support parallel and sequential requests.
Visual workflow designer integrated into the GUI.
Customizable Templates

Save and apply request templates for commonly used API calls.
Template variables for quick customization.
Share templates with team members.
API Documentation Sync

Auto-sync API definitions from Genesys Cloud or custom Swagger/OpenAPI URLs.
Highlight API changes between versions.
Provide inline documentation and examples per endpoint.
Collaboration Features

User authentication and role-based access control within the app.
Commenting and annotation on saved requests.
Sharing saved requests and templates across a team.

Export API calls as part of build or deployment pipelines.
Output API responses to logs or monitoring dashboards.
Trigger external scripts or workflows on API call success/failure.
Advanced Debugging Tools

Include HTTP traffic inspection (headers, raw request/response).
Extensibility & Plugin System


# Enhancement Plan & Feature Integration

Your current app is solid, but to surpass the developer.genesys.cloud portal in usability and value, consider the following enhancements:

### 1. **Improved User Experience & Usability**

- **Persistent OAuth Token Management**
  - Securely store the OAuth token locally (already implemented with DPAPI).

- **Enhanced Parameter Input**
  - For parameters with enums, replace free text with dropdowns.
  - For boolean parameters, use checkboxes.
  - For array inputs, provide a JSON editor with syntax highlighting or a multi-line textbox with validation.

- **Comprehensive HTTP Method Support**
  - Only support POST bodies and GET; Remove support to Put, Patch, DELETE API endpoints.

- **Request History & Reuse**
  - Maintain a history of recent API calls (paths, methods, parameters, and bodies) allowing quick reuse and editing.

- **Improved Async Handling & Progress Feedback**
  - Add a progress spinner or a progress bar during async API calls.
  - Disable only relevant controls during the request to keep UI responsive.

- **Enhanced Response Viewer**
  - Syntax-highlighted, collapsible JSON viewer for API responses.
  - Option to toggle raw or formatted view.

- **Error Handling & Logging**
  - Detailed error display with HTTP status code, headers, and message.
  - Option to export error logs.

---

### 2. **Developer-Focused Features**

- **Swagger/OpenAPI Integration**
  - Support loading multiple Swagger/OpenAPI specs dynamically.
  - Display endpoint descriptions and parameter metadata inline.

- **Request Customization**
  - Allow setting custom headers beyond Authorization and Content-Type.
  - Support multipart/form-data for file uploads.

- **Code Snippet Generation**
  - Generate cURL and PowerShell Invoke-RestMethod snippets side-by-side.

- **Schema-aware Example Generation**
  - Better example request body generation from schema with nested objects and arrays.

---

### 3. **UI/UX Layout and Accessibility**

- Responsive layout to handle resizing.
- Keyboard shortcuts for common actions (submit, clear, save).
- Tooltips and inline help for parameters and buttons.
- Dark mode toggle.

---

# Implementation: Part 1 - Foundation & UI Improvements

Below is the first part of the enhanced script focusing on:

- UI layout refinements with resizing support.
- Parameter input improvements (checkboxes for booleans, comboboxes for enums).
- Token management with test token button.
- Request history UI and data structure.
- Enhanced async request handling with progress indicator.
